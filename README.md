# MaxMinGenerics

This module is about to find the maximum of numbers , integers , strings and any data type which are comparable using java generics

 This module contains 
 1. com/bridgelabz/maxfinder (this is the folder structure for .java files )
 2. classFiles/com/bridgelabz/maxfinder (this is the folder structure for .class files)

 If any one wants import this packages , use com.bridgelaz.maxfinder

 This package has com.bridgelaz.maxfinder following files : 
 1. GenericMaxFinder.java  : This is a public class for finding max among any data types or maximum in arrays.
 2. MaxMin.java : This is a public class for finding max of three number float , string , int seperately
 3. MaxFinderApplication : This is the application file where we use and test the above two files with inputs

The master branch contains following subbranches : 

1. Use Case 1 - finding maximum when three integers are given

3. Use Case 3 - finding maximum when three strings are given

   link to branch : https://github.com/mahidhar-25/MaxMinGenerics/tree/UC_3_Find_Max_When_Three_Strings_Are_Given

4. Use Case 4 - Extend the methods to take more than three variables and find maximum among them

   link to branch : https://github.com/mahidhar-25/MaxMinGenerics/tree/UC_4_Extend_The_Max_Method_To_Take_More_Than_Three_Variables

5. Use Case 5 - Refactoring the code and writing generic methods to find maximum and printing it.
